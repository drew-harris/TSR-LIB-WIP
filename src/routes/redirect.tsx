      <h2>Redirect</h2>

      <p>
        This route redirects if the `doRedirect=true` search param is present. Should support redirect on the server as
        well on first load when relevant.
      </p>

      <p>NOTE: the server side of things doesn't seem to be working atm. Could be an issue in tanstack router.</p>

      <p>
        <Link to="/redirect" search={{ doRedirect: true }}>
          Redirect
        </Link>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
